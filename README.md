#Project Name: Voice-Controlled AI Assistant

##Description:

The Voice-Controlled AI Assistant is a Python-based project that empowers users to interact with their computer using voice commands. This AI-powered assistant, named "Veronica," offers a hands-free and efficient way to perform various tasks and obtain information.

###Key Features:

Voice Recognition: Veronica uses the SpeechRecognition library to accurately transcribe spoken words into text, allowing users to communicate with their computer naturally.
` pip3 install speechrecognition`
` pip install pyaudio`

Text-to-Speech Output: With the help of the win32com.client library, Veronica responds to user commands and queries with clear and friendly spoken responses.
